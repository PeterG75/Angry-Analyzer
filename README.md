# Angry-Analyzer
Angry Analyzer is a wifi packet analysis tool that can create graphs from captured packet fields. One can export wifi captured packets to csv file using Aircrack-ng set of tools and Angry Analyzer can plot graphs from that csv file.

Special thanks to Pentester Academy and Vivek ramachandran for creating WIfi Analyzer, based on that, Angry Analyzer is being created. Problem with that tool was no availability of source code because of action script. But now everything is in PHP. So feel free to add your ideas.

Found any bug, feel free to report fix code and I'll add your name in the project.
